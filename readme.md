# Sudoku (and solver)

## Packages used:
The popular package - pygame <br/>

## Description
* This is a simple sudoku solver/visualizer which uses backtracking at its core.
* Pygame is used for the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* You can give any partial sudoku as input to the program, try to find the solution for each empty squre, ask if that is a correct guess.
* Or you can ask the computer to solve the sudoku from where you left it.
* We can visualize the working of the backtracking algorithm in the GUI.
* If a square turns red, it is a wrong guess by the computer and it backtracks till the last correct guess and starts guessing different numbers for that square.

## Instructions:
* Have the files icon.png, main.py, data.txt in the same directory.
* Input the file data.txt with any sudoku puzzle you may want to solve, with 0 in the places of empty squares.
* Run the file main.py
* Click on the import button if you want to import data from data.txt or you can fill whichever square you want to input a number.
* You can check if the number you guessed is a correct guess by clicking on the check button.
* If you want to computer to try and solve it completely, you can click on the solve button, at any stage.
* If you want to reset the board, you can click on the reset button.
* You can again import using the import button/edit the data.txt file with a new puzzle and run everything again.
